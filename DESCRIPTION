Description: Provides an interface to the C++ FILEVECTOR library
    facilitating analysis using large (giga- to tera-bytes) matrices.
    Matrix storage is organized in a way that either columns or rows
    are quickly accessible. DatABEL is primarily aimed to support
    genome-wide association analyses e.g. using GenABEL, MixABEL and
    ProbABEL.
